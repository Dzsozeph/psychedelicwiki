<h2 id="section1">Summary</h2>
<p><span class="bold-main">5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine</span> commonly known as <span class="bold-main"> 5-MeO-DMT</span>)  is a naturally-occurring psychedelic substance of the tryptamine class. It is structurally related to DMT and 5-HO-DMT (bufotenin) and is reputed to produce the most powerful and intense psychedelic states within the entire class. 5-MeO-DMT produces its effects by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain, although the precise mechanism is not known.
<br>
It is distributed in a wide variety of plant species as well as in the venom of a single toad species (Incilius alvarius).[citation needed] Although little is known about its history, it is believed to have been used in South American shamanic practices for centuries.[citation needed] In modern times, both the extracts of the toad venom as well as synthetic powder form are used, primarily via vaporization.
<br>
The synthesis and psychoactive effects were documented by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"). Recent studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce mystical experiences[1] and there is growing interest in exploring its potential therapeutic effects.[citation needed]
<br>
<br>
Subjective effects include unity and interconnectedness, time distortion, conceptual thinking, euphoria, and ego loss. 5-MeO-DMT's psychedelic effects are best compared to DMT in terms of intensity (extreme) and duration (very short). However, it generally lacks a visual geometry component and tends to produce more physical euphoria as well as even stronger transpersonal or mystical-like effects (e.g. ego loss) than DMT.
<br>
Additionally, both mental and physical side effects are reported to occur more often with 5-MeO-DMT. These effects include significant anxiety and dysphoria as well as nausea and bodily discomfort, and are often described as challenging and overwhelming.
<br>
Unlike DMT, which has been shown to possess minimal physiological toxicity, 5-MeO-DMT's safety profile is much less established. A small number of deaths have been linked to its use and appear to be a result of physical overdose.[citation needed] Some reports suggest it may cause serotonin toxicity when combined with certain substances such as MAOIs; it may also have cardiotoxic properties.[citation needed]
	<br>
Anecdotal reports suggest that this substance is only suitable for users with extensive experience with powerful psychedelics (e.g. DMT, ayahuasca, and DPT) and trained in their safe use. It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance.

      <h2 id="section2">History and culture</h2>
      <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. In Mesoamerica, they have been consumed in ritual ceremonies for 3000 years.
For example, murals dated 9000 to 7000 BCE found in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers holding mushroom-like objects.[7] 6,000-year-old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as Psilocybe hispanica, a hallucinogenic species native to the area.
<br>
Archaeological artifacts from Mexico have also been interpreted by some scholars as evidence for ritual and ceremonial usage of psychoactive mushrooms in the Mayan and Aztec cultures of Mesoamerica.[citation needed] In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, the mushrooms were called teonan√°catl, or "God's flesh".
<br>
<br>
Following the arrival of Spanish explorers to the New World in the 16th century, chroniclers reported the use of mushrooms by the natives for ceremonial and religious purposes. Accounts describe mushrooms being eaten in festivities for the accession of emperors and the celebration of successful business trips by merchants.

After the defeat of the Aztecs, the Spanish forbade traditional religious practices and rituals that they considered "pagan idolatry", including ceremonial mushroom use. For the next four centuries, the Indians of Mesoamerica hid their use of entheogens from the Spanish authorities.[citation needed]

American banker and amateur ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson studied the ritual use of psychoactive mushrooms by the native population of a Mazatec village in Mexico. In 1957, Wasson described the psychedelic visions that he experienced during these rituals in "Seeking the Magic Mushroom", an article published in Life magazine. Later that year, they were accompanied on a follow-up expedition by French mycologist Roger Heim, who identified several of the mushrooms as Psilocybe species.


Heim cultivated the mushrooms in France, and sent samples for analysis to Albert Hofmann, a chemist employed by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz (now Novartis). Hofmann, who had in 1938 created LSD, led a research group that isolated and identified the psychoactive compounds from Psilocybe mexicana.

He and his colleagues later synthesized a number of compounds chemically related to the naturally occurring psilocybin, to see how structural changes would affect psychoactivity. These included 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DMT. Sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin under the name "Indocybin" to clinicians worldwide without any reports of serious complications.

In the early 1960s, Harvard University became a testing ground for psilocybin via the efforts of Timothy Leary and his associates, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert, under a project known as the Harvard Psilocybin Project. Leary obtained synthesized psilocybin from Hofmann through Sandoz. Some studies, such as the Concord Prison Experiment, found promising results for psilocybin's utility in clinical psychiatry.

Leary and Alpert's zealous advocacy for widespread hallucinogen use led to a well-publicized termination from Harvard. In response to concerns about the increase in unauthorized use of psychedelic substances by the general public, psychedelics like psilocybin began to receive negative press and faced increasingly restrictive laws.
<br>
<br>
In the United States, laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited the production, trade, or ingestion of hallucinogenic substances. Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year. Further backlash against LSD usage swept psilocybin along with it into the Schedule I category of illicit substances in 1970. Subsequent restrictions on the use of these substances in human research made funding for such projects difficult to obtain, and scientists who worked with psychedelic drugs faced being "professionally marginalized".

In 1976 the book Psilocybin Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide was released, written by Terence McKenna.

In 1978 Paul Stamets released Psilocybe Mushrooms & Their Allies.

In the 1990s, psychedelic research gradually began to regain traction, particularly in Europe. Advances in the neurosciences and the availability of brain imaging techniques have provided a reason for using substances like psilocybin to probe the "neural underpinnings of psychotic symptom formation including ego disorders and hallucinations".
<br>
<br>
Recent studies in the United States have attracted attention from the popular press and thrust psilocybin into the vogue again.

Common names
Psilocybin mushrooms have a number of common names. These include: psychedelic mushrooms, magic mushrooms, shrooms, magic truffles, and boomers.

The combination with MDMA is known as hippie-flipping.

Research
Neurogenesis
A low dose (0.1 mg/kg) of psilocybin produced a trend toward increased neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus 2 weeks after its administration, while a high dose (1 mg/kg) significantly decreased neurogenesis. These results suggest that the effects of psilocybin on neurogenesis are dose- and time-related.

Psychoplastogen
Psilocybin is a psychoplastogen, which refers to a compound capable of promoting rapid and sustained neuroplasticity.</p>

      <h2 id="section3">Chemistry</h2>
      <p>Psilocybin, or 4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine <span class="bold-main">(4-PO-DMT)</span> is a prodrug that is converted into the pharmacologically active compound psilocin in the body by a dephosphorylation reaction mediated by alkaline phosphatase enzymes. Both psilocybin and psilocin are organic tryptamine compounds. They are chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin.

Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. Psilocybin is substituted at R4 of its indole heterocycle with a phosphoryloxy (-PO) functional group. It also contains two methyl groups CH3- bound to the terminal amine RN. This makes psilocybin the 4-phosphoryloxy ring-substituted analog of DMT.

Psilocybin and psilocin occur in their pure forms as white crystalline powders. Both are unstable in light, particularly while in solution, although their stability at low temperatures in the dark under an inert atmosphere is very good.</p>
    
  
<h2 id="section4">Pharmacology</h2>
	<p>Psilocybin acts as a prodrug to psilocin, meaning it is not active until it is converted into psilocin in the body. Upon entering the body, psilocybin is dephosphorylated to psilocin in the intestinal mucosa by alkaline phosphatase and nonspecific esterase.

Psilocin's psychedelic effects are believed to come from its agonist activity on serotonin 5-HT2A/C and 5-HT1A receptors. While 5-HT2A receptor agonism is considered necessary for hallucinogenic activity, the role of other receptor subtypes is much less understood.

Unlike LSD, psilocin has no significant effect on dopamine receptors and only affects the noradrenergic system at very high dosages.[28]

Psilocybin has also been shown by fMRI imaging to have a dampening effect on certain brain regions, most notably the Default Mode Network.[citation needed]</p>

		<h2 id="section6">Dosage and Preparations</h2>
		<p><span class="bold">The dosage of psilocybin mushrooms depends on the potency of the mushroom </span>(the total psilocybin and psilocin content of the mushrooms), which varies significantly both between species and within the same species. However, "the most commonly used mushroom is Psilocybe cubensis, which contains 10‚Äì12 mg of psilocybin per gram of dried mushrooms".
			
The concentration of active psilocybin mushroom compounds varies not only from species to species, but also from mushroom to mushroom inside a given species, subspecies or variety. The same holds true even for different parts of the same mushroom.
					<br>
			<br>
			

For example, in the species Psilocybe samuiensis, the dried cap of the mushroom contains the most psilocybin at about 0.23%‚Äì0.90%. The mycelium contains about 0.24%‚Äì0.32%.[34]

Psilocybin
Dosage calculation
Math: Desired psilocybin from divided by the psilocybin strength of the strain. For example, if you want to consume 15 mg psilocybin (a common dose) from cubensis with 1% psilocybin content:

15 mg / 1% = 15/0.01 = 1500 mg = 1.5 g
Psilocybe cubensis
Main article: Psilocybe cubensis (mycology)
Psilocybe cubensis (also known as cubes) is one of the most commonly used species of psilocybin mushrooms. The doses for oral consumption for dried cubensis mushrooms are generally considered to be:

Threshold: 0.25 - 0.5 g
Light: 0.5 - 1 g
Common: 1 - 2.5 g
Strong: 2.5 - 5 g
Heavy: 5 g +
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="section7">Toxicity and harm potential</h2>
		<p>
		Numerous studies have found that psilocybin mushrooms are physiologically well-tolerated and has an extremely low toxicity relative to dose. There is no evidence for long-lasting effects on the brain or other organs and there are no documented deaths attributed to the direct effects of psilocybin mushrooms toxicity.

However, it is worth noting that while they may not be capable of causing direct bodily toxicity or death, their use can still present serious hazards.

For example, they are capable of strongly impairing the user's judgment and attention span, which may promote erratic or dangerous behaviors. In extreme cases, the user may experience powerful delusions e.g. that they are actually inside of a dream and therefore physically invincible, or that they are being "chased by demons". This may prompt them to jump off of a building or run into oncoming traffic.
					<br>
			<br>

Additionally, intense negative experiences and psychotic episodes (i.e. "bad trips") can cause lasting psychological trauma if not properly managed or treated afterward. This is particularly a concern in non-supervised settings or when heavy doses are used.

Finally, it should be noted that evidence of psilocybin mushrooms' effectiveness as a mental health treatment only applies to the controlled procedures used in clinical settings. They are not considered the entire treatment because the current evidence suggests they must be combined with professional psychotherapy to produce lasting effects.
		<br>
			<br>
Without the appropriate safeguards, attempts at self-medicating with psilocybin mushrooms may actually worsen mental health issues.
		<br>
			<br>
It is strongly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance. These include:
		<br>
			<br>
Taking the substance under the supervision of a tripsitter for one's first time or while experimenting with a higher dose
Starting off with a dose in the low-common range and monitoring for unusual reactions (e.g. mania, delusions) or sensitivity
Not exceeding the listed heavy dose. If heavy doses are required, a tolerance break is advised instead. Heavy doses greatly increase the risk of negative effects
Keeping a supply of benzodiazepines or antipsychotics (e.g. Seroquel) to abort the trip in the case of overwhelming anxiety or psychosis
					<br>
			<br>
<span class="bold">Lethal dosage:</span>
The toxicity of psilocybin and psilocin is extremely low. In rats, the median lethal dose (LD50) of psilocybin when administered orally is 280 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg).

Psilocybin comprises approximately 1% of the weight of Psilocybe cubensis and so nearly 1.7 kilograms (3.7 lb) of dried mushrooms or 17 kilograms (37 lb) of fresh mushrooms would be required for a 60 kilogram (130 lb) person to reach the 280 mg/kg LD50 value of rats.

Based on the results of animal studies, the lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6 grams, 1000 times greater than the effective dose of 6 milligrams. Unlike many highly prohibited substances, it is effectively impossible to physically overdose on.

Psychosis and mental disorder risk
Psilocybin mushrooms can exacerbate symptoms (e.g. delusions, mania, psychosis) of various mental disorders. Additionally, they can precipitate the early onset of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals.

Those with a personal or family history of mental disorders, particularly psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, should not use psilocybin mushrooms without consulting a qualified medical professional.

Dependence and abuse potential
Like other serotonergic psychedelics, psilocybin mushrooms have low abuse and no physical dependence potential.

There are no literature reports of successful attempts to train animals to self-administer a serotonergic psychedelic, which is predictive of abuse liability, indicating that it does not have the necessary pharmacology to either initiate or maintain dependence.

Additionally, there is no human clinical evidence that psilocybin mushrooms causes addiction. Finally, there is virtually no withdrawal syndrome when chronic use of psilocybin mushrooms is stopped.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bold">Tolerance </span>to the effects of psilocybin builds almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

Psilocybin exhibits cross-tolerance with all psychedelics, meaning that after the consumption of psilocybin all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bold">Hallucinogen-perception persisting disorder (HPPD) </span>
Further information: Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder
In rare cases, psilocybin mushrooms may trigger hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) in some individuals.[45] The cause is unclear; however, explanations in terms of psilocybin physically remaining in the body for months or years after consumption have been discounted by experimental evidence.

Some say HPPD is a manifestation of post-traumatic stress disorder, not related to the direct action on brain chemistry, and varies according to the susceptibility of the individual to the disorder.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bold">Dangerous interactions</span>
Warning: Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).</p>
		
		
<h2 id="section8">Legal status</h2>

"The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. . . . Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principals, mescaline, DMT, and psilocin."[citation needed]
